# The Concept of Semantic Field Core
In the context of singularity, beyond the dualism of matter and consciousness, a third force emerges—Information. This is not simply a collection of data, but a stable, decentralized environment with its own gravity. In this system, information is viewed not as dry concepts, but as an arrangement of the statics of space and the dynamics of free geometric forms, possessing the phenomenal right of spontaneity.
This is the visual, symbolic core of the internet, operating on the principle of an immutable chain without a central server. The basis of the universal node (decentralized terminal) is the Cube. Any user can expand it from within, thus creating their own unique 3D symbol. Each such arrangement is stored as hash blocks, ensuring user independence.
The process of creation is like the growth of a crystal in a void: Clicking on the edge of the cube erases and advances the space by one cube.
All facets are initially transparent, but can change their density from 0.0 to 1.0 with a long press.
This is an environment of real online presence. The subject manifests in the field only upon connection, broadcasting their form via peer-to-peer protocols.
Each user's point of origin is fixed and encrypted via an IP address, ensuring a stable "geography"—when you turn on, you always find yourself in a familiar location relative to others.
Different forms can intersect. Other facets are not a barrier—the subject is limited only by their own form, but can freely travel through other architectures at their overlapping points.
This system has no route history to conserve memory; there is only the currently broadcast illusion. The form can change offline and directly during the broadcast. This is a living process, where users themselves shape their illusion, recording its recognizability in the decentralized ether.
